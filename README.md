## Tree definitions:
**Height of node** – The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.

**Depth** –The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.
The depth of the **root** is 0.

**Level** – The level of a node is defined by 1 + the number of connections between the node and the root.
Simply, level is **depth plus 1**.

**Height of tree** –The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
The height of the **root** is 1.
